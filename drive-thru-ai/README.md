🧩 **Usage**

🔐 Setting Up Environment Variables: 

Create a .env file in the root of your project and add below line.

> PORT=3001

🎙️ Voice Command Support:
This project integrates the Vapi library to enable voice-based interaction.
However, voice functionality does not work on localhost due to CORS policy restrictions.

To enable voice features during local development, use ngrok to expose your local server.

🚀 Steps to Use ngrok
Sign up for ngrok and install your authtoken.

Start ngrok with this command:

 - ngrok http --url=localhost 3001

example: ngrok http --url=national-tough-ghost.ngrok-free.app 3001

Use the generated ngrok URL in your application instead of localhost.
