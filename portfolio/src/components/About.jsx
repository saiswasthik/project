          I'm an AI + Python Backend Developer passionate about building scalable, intelligent systems. What began as curiosity for automation evolved into a drive to create backend solutions that power real-world impact.

With hands-on experience in Python, FastAPI, MySQL, and REST APIs, I specialize in turning complex problems into clean, high-performance systems. I'm especially excited by the intersection of AI and backend development â€” from integrating ML models to designing API-driven architectures that learn and adapt.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
          Beyond coding, I explore emerging tech, contribute to open-source, and dive into LLMs and Generative AI. I believe in continuous learning, collaboration, and building tech that solves real problems.

Let's create something innovative â€” together.
